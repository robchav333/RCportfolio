     <h3>Final Project</h3>
         <h5 style="color:green;" >Artist Statement</h5>

     <p>As a student in college there are many events that affect our daily lives and our mental health. From assigned homework, bills, jobs, relationships, etc. We can tend to create an unorganized motive to balance these tasks and successfully getting them done. I will create experiments that cultivate awareness of the present moment and clear the mind of other thoughts, to help with decision making to complete these tasks. I will be conducting a few Meditation Exercises to see how it can reduce my stress levels, thus allowing me to organize my thoughts and make decisions. </p>

          <p>
For the final project I chose to upgrade my inclosure. I lasered cutted a wooden box, a plexie glass top,painted one side with acrylic, and lastly added my buttons and LEDs. Successfully I was able to reduce my mental stress from meditating between 10-20 minutes which occurred during the second meditation that I did.  Also, I realized I am able to adjust my stress and decision making into getting tasks completed due the meditation exercises as they are helpful tools. The GSR is a helpful tool to interact with people. The GSR test allows to visually see results and record them for future complications with student and personal life tasks. Also it is a tool that can help dictate stress in a visual way or even conduct a variety of different experiments that can help figure out why we feel the way we do in our daily lives. However, the GSR may not always be right in terms of dictating stress depending on the person where their personal stress levels may affect results. I think it has potential for a decision technique. Depending on what you want to experiment with like different meditations or music choices, and factoring coding into manipulating how the GSR responds to your liking; I think the visual graph in Arduino was the biggest reliable source that helped make my decisions. Again, it allowed me to see how my body was reacting to my exercises that I tried and helped me make decisions in the end.

         <!-- <h5> Phase 1 GSR sensor experiments and log</h5>
         <p>To start off from March 29th-April 1st I started off test my "stress" levels with some daily routines of mine. I tried not immediately
           not making my coffee right away in the morning but waited a couple of hours after I woke up to see how i reacted. Also during these days,
           around mid day I would see if I got hungry around 3pm and checked my stress levels then. Finally at night depending if I found it hard to fall asleep
           I would check my levels again.I found that the gsr levels would only range from 650 - 750; so no real changes with my daily life.
          </p>

       <p>To test my stress levels further I experimented with new activities within my daily routine.The three activities I chose were a 15 minute meditation, watching
         a comedy show, and documenting how I felt after drinking a cup of coffee in the morning. The meditation kept a minor steady pace in the 800 range of plotter graph.
         Watching a comedy show had the most noticable change of stress level. I saw a steady pace in the graph in that one ranging in 900 that lasted for about 10 seconds more than
       the other two activities. Last was drinking a cup of coffee were the range ranged in 800-900 but would go up and down in range. I was curious because of the effect in ranges was
     due to no food in my stomach and just waking up. </p> -->

    <p>
    For the show I was in charge with the video editing process of three students work for the project. One of students who I collaborated with in making the video was Yeab Kebede. She supplied me with other students files and helped with animations. I also worked on intro and ending scenes with the assets I was given. I made about three rough drafts of the video, getting feeding from Yeab and the instructor Steve Durie. All together in the final the video, I edited in found footage, voice overs, photos and records, titles and descriptions, and music. The video duration is just under 8 minutes.

         <p>I added my experiment meditation video for the gallery show along with the other students.    </p>
           <p>I also helped out with the breakdown of the show on the week it was presented.     </p>
